This is an empty Vue JS setup

1. Clone this repository

2. Run the build process

    ``` bash
    # install dependencies first time
    npm install
    
    # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
    npm run dev
    ```
    or
    ```
    # build for production with minification
    npm run build
    ```

3. Use your artistic license to create and style the following wireframe to the best of your ability using HTML, CSS and javascript
    
    ![Wireframe](./wireframe.png)
    
    Logos are in `src/assets` and users are in `src/data`

If this is too easy then see if you can use vue components, import the data or even create a mobile response version.
